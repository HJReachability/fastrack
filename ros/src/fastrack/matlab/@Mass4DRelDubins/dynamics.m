%% Defines the dynamics for the Mass4DRelDubins MATLAB class, consisting in
%% the relative dynamics between a planar point mass tracker and a Dubins car
%% planner. The reference frame is aligned with the Dubins car, with velocities
%% and accelerations expressed in the inertial frame (but along the body axes).

function dx = dynamics(obj, ~, x, u, d, ~)
% State
%   x(1): distance (r)
%   x(2): bearing (theta)
%   x(3): tangent_velocity (v_t)
%   x(4): normal_velocity  (v_n)
%
% Tracker control (note this requires outside translation into tracker frame)
%   u(1): tangent_acceleration (a_t)
%   u(2): normal_acceleration (a_n)
%
% Planner control
%   d(1): angular_rate (omega)
%
% Disturbance input
%   d(2): tangent_acceleration_disturbance (d_t)
%   d(3): normal_acceleration_disturbance (d_n)
%
% Parameters
%   v_: Dubins car (fixed) speed
%
% Dynamics
%   r_dot     = (v_t - v_) * cos(theta) + v_n * sin(theta)
%   theta_dot = -omega + ( -(v_t-v_) * sin(theta) + v_n * cos(theta) ) / r
%   v_t_dot   = a_t + d_t + v_n * omega
%   v_n_dot   = a_n + d_n - v_t * omega
%
% Input constraints (for reference only)
%   omega \in Ball(0, omega_max_)
%   (a_t, a_n) \in Ball(0,a_max_)
%   (d_t, d_n) \in Ball(0,d_max_)
%

% TODO: It's probably not ideal to use polar coordinates for the grid!
% Consider using Cartesian grid and transforming into polar inside the dynamics.
% For the cell at the origin (singularity in polar), set theta to 0 manually.
