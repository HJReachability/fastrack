%% Computes the Tracking Error Bound (TEB) for Mass4DRelDubins.
%% The current version of the code is set up as a script, and parameters are
%% defined below——modify the parameters to compute the TEB for different cases.

%function ComputeTEB()
% 1. Run Backward Reachable Set (BRS) with a goal
%     uMode = 'min' <-- goal
%     minWith = 'none' <-- Set (not tube)
%     compTraj = false <-- no trajectory
% 2. Run BRS with goal, then optimal trajectory
%     uMode = 'min' <-- goal
%     minWith = 'none' <-- Set (not tube)
%     compTraj = true <-- compute optimal trajectory
% 3. Run Backward Reachable Tube (BRT) with a goal, then optimal trajectory
%     uMode = 'min' <-- goal
%     minWith = 'zero' <-- Tube (not set)
%     compTraj = true <-- compute optimal trajectory
% 4. Add disturbance
%     dStep1: define a dMax (dMax = [.25, .25, 0];)
%     dStep2: define a dMode (opposite of uMode)
%     dStep3: input dMax when creating your DubinsCar
%     dStep4: add dMode to schemeData
% 5. Change to an avoid BRT rather than a goal BRT
%     uMode = 'max' <-- avoid
%     dMode = 'min' <-- opposite of uMode
%     minWith = 'zero' <-- Tube (not set)
%     compTraj = false <-- no trajectory
% 6. Change to a Forward Reachable Tube (FRT)
%     add schemeData.tMode = 'forward'
%     note: now having uMode = 'max' essentially says "see how far I can
%     reach"
% 7. Add obstacles
%     add the following code:
%     obstacles = shapeCylinder(g, 3, [-1.5; 1.5; 0], 0.75);
%     HJIextraArgs.obstacles = obstacles;
