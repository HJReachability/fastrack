# MATLAB reachability scripts
The scripts in this directory allow numerically computing the value function and optimal control/disturbance for different tracker-planner pairs using their relative dynamics.
The results can be imported into FaSTrack through the MatlabValueFunction class.

## Dependencies
The MATLAB scripts in this folder require MATLAB and depend on the following repositories.
- helperOC, an optimal control toolbox for Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability Analysis (https://github.com/HJReachability/helperOC.git)
- The Level Set Methods Toolbox by Ian Mitchell (https://bitbucket.org/ian_mitchell/toolboxls).

## Quick-start guide
To begin using the MATLAB scripts in this directory, please refer to the "Introduction to Reachability Code" pdf in the helperOC repository.
